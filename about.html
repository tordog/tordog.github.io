		<h1>ABOUT<br>VICTORIA</h1>
		<div class="about_text"> <img src = "./images/Victoria.jpg" style = "width: 150px; height:auto; float:left; padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px">Welcome to my website! My name is Victoria (I often go by Torie), and I am a Computer Science major from Palo Alto, California. I am a current senior at Yale University, expected graduation May 2016. I began programming during my freshman year of college, and since then I have steadily progressed through the CS courses at Yale. Some of my favorite courses include Computer Graphics, Intelligent Robotics, and Computer Organization and Architecture. On campus, I am President of <a href="http://floatyale.com">Float Yale</a>, a Computer Science organization on campus aimed at diversifying Yale's Computer Science field. <br><br>

		Beyond Computer Science, I enjoy art (I have enjoyed several art classes at Yale), running, reading, writing, and eating. I grew up in the Bay Area for the entirety of my youth, with 3 brothers (1 older, 2 younger) whom I love very much. While New Haven has treated me well, I hope to return the the Bay Area soon! <br><br>
